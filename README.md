#YNAP Code Test
This is a code test for YNAP.
Is a Roman number converter.

## Setup
- open your terminal a go to this repository
- run `yarn install` or `npm install` to install the dependencies
- open tew different tabs in your terminal
- if you are using yarn, run `yarn start:server` to start the server and `yarn start:client` to run the client side
- if you are usin npm, run `npm run start:server` and `npm run start:client` in order to run the server and the client side

You will need [node](https://nodejs.org/) set up on your local environment.
## Features
This app allows users to convert Roman numbers to integer and vice-versa.

## The build
- ReactJS (Front-End)
- NodeJs (Back-End)
 
## Approach
First I started to work on the logic. how to convert the integer in Roman number and vice-versa.
After that, I moved to React and I start to implement my logic to the components to check if it was working. Once I got the frontend working, I decide to move on to the backend and move the logic there.

The hard part for me was going back to work with React. I haven't used it for almost one year so I was a bit rusty.

Maybe I could save all the conversions in order to show them on a different page and work a bit more on the style.
